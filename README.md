# Advent of Code

This repository stores every advent of code challenge I solved.

Each year has it's own folder, most configuration for different language environments are at the root

## Additional Challenge

I gave my self a little extra on top of the challenges, that being the programming language I use.

I change language every 5 days.

- Day 1 to 5: **`Python`**
- Day 6 to 10: **`Typescript`**
- Day 11 to 15 **`Rust`**
- Day 16 to 20 **`To determine (probably object oriented like java)`**
- Day 20 to 25 changes for every year:
    - 2022: **`To determine`**
    - 2023: **`To determine`**
